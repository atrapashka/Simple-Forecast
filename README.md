  What is all about?

Simple-Forecast - it's one of the task that I complete in courses <img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6431-3066-4264-b661-306535386264/logo.svg" width="100">

The main requirement for this app was working with API (in my app it's OpenWeather) and multithreading, daily and hourly forecast for location from LocationManager, working with custom cells in Table/CollectionView.

There's some special things about it:
- Background cover changes in dependency with type of weather (sun, clouds, rain, snow and etc.)
- You can see daily and hourly weather in real time.
- You can find your city or place (not ready, still in process)
- Planning to add: MapKit, CoreData, searcbar, language localization, screen with favourite places.
- Planning to improve: code, update UI, GCD & Memory management
